##Project Description:
Simple FPS Shooter made with unity. We based our preliminary ideas off of
the PC game DOOM. Our game includes enemies with basic AI, environmental features
such as doors/walls, lava. We support 3 different weapon types.

Right now, our game is intended to be run from within Unity. Our game could be made
to an executable as is, but we intend for this to be something not only for players,
but other developers to build off of to make their own games.

##BUILD PROCESS:
* Download the latest version of Unity from their website. This also includes
  downloading Visual Studio (included in the download package from Unity).
* From Unity, open a project, and select the folder containing the game.
* Once the project has been opened in Unity, select Assets > scene_main.unity to
  load the scene where our game takes place.
* Once the scene is loaded, press the play button at the top of Unity. This
  will start the game.
* To end the simulation, press escape, and then press the play button again.
